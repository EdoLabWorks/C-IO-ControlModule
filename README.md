# C++ IO-ControlModule

A simple and quick console app to move data between NodeJS WebControl and its backend server.

For now, this app will only work on Linux OS.

### Usage
To try it, just build it using any C++0x/C++11 compliant compiler and run it as a service app for our web control client.

Download [NodeJS web control](https://github.com/EdoLabWorks/NodeJS-Web-Control-Project) app and run it as a separate process.
